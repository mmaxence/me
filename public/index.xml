      <description>We‚Äôve shared a first story about how we started a study between engineers and designers. The outcome was a lot of fun and a CI pipeline from Figma to Android environment called Phantom Box. This story is about the second act of our study.
This time we‚Äôve decided to pinpoint a problem within our company and try fixing it. It needed to be a small scale project just for us to be incubating the whole development process altogether.</description>

      <description>About a year ago we started a small study group with engineers and designers to understand each other better. It was an insightful and fun experience. Fun enough to run 2 different projects summarized over 2 different stories. Here is the first one, sharing both designer and engineer points of views.
At buzzvil we can freely start a study group, lunch being supported for the occasion. It was enough reason for us 5 to start questioning our workflow, 3 product designers and 2 engineers (client &amp;amp; devOps) on a weekly basis.</description>

      <description>This website uses the light-weight Hugo Framework coupled with the Theme Ananke as my starter.
I keep the repository public on my Github if you want to have a look at it. üòè
Ananke is based on the truly impressive Tachyons CSS Library.</description>

      <title>Design system at Buzzvil</title>

      <description>Design system vs startup. Takeaways.
We built a Design system. It took us time, resources and a lot of energy, involving pretty much everyone in our design team. And it‚Äôs just the beginning of a long story. If you are working at a startup and are considering building a design system, you might find clues reading about our experience.
First off, we can‚Äôt ignore how time consuming building a system can be.</description>

      <title>Design peer reviews to support our team growth</title>

      <description>I always hope to see my teammates collaborate more. Now that we are at a stage of faster growth, more fellow designers are going to join us and it felt like a good timing to push forward this all peer-review strategy.
It‚Äôs never too late. We‚Äôve been a team of 4 designers for the last 2 years, including 2 product / 2 visual designers. Collaboration &amp;amp; Review have been naturally there as soon as the team got 2 product designers, but it‚Äôs never been a thing across the entire team, probably due to the fact that some of our designers are working remotely, bringing communication issues.</description>

      <description>Hi, I‚Äôm Max and I lead a team of designers at Buzzvil. When we‚Äôve decided last year to drastically change our design toolbox, I was pleased to find plenty of insights from other teams around the world. This post talks about our decisions and related needs!
To give a quick background, we are a team of 5 designers located in Seoul and Taipei. The team counts 3 Product designers including myself and 2 visual - Brand designers.</description>
