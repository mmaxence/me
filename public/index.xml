      <title>High output management: identifying and measuring your design outputs</title>

      <description>Design oriented Takeaways from Andrew Grove‚Äôs best seller. My CEO strongly recommended me to read ‚ÄúHigh output management‚Äù a while ago as my team was growing and my management responsibilities accentuated. It eventually gave me some of the most valuable insights for me to grow as a manager. This article analyses and translates my personal experiences, describing how I translated Grove‚Äôs inputs into my Design lead routine. But first I‚Äôd like to start with a short back story to understand where I come from.</description>

      <description>A snap taken during our last sprint prior to publish our system online
This is a healthy, yearly routine I genuinely recommend to follow regardless of the size of your team: gauging your current toolbox against what‚Äôs new in the busy design tool industry. We are a team of 6 designers (3 visual &amp;amp; 3 product designers). We conducted our research and tests with a focus on design systems. You‚Äôll find tons of other articles about this, we‚Äôve read them all (or close) and now posting our share to the chain :).</description>

      <title>Design Tempo: the art of managing creative pace</title>

      <description>Designers, like musicians, need to play in diapason in order to come up with melodious experiences. üé∂
This is a subjective essay, a short read about Creative team pace management. It is based on experience, discussions with peers over the years, personal thoughts &amp;amp; analysis.
Designers are managing creativity to answer business needs. Creativity and creative teams cannot be managed like any other field. Designers just like any specialists need specific management skills.</description>

      <description>How to avoid friction when receiving feedback on your design. It usually starts like this:
 I don‚Äôt like the blue here, can you please change to something more&amp;hellip; red-ish?
 This is generally enough for a designer‚Äôs face to turn.. üò° red-ish and internally blame the poor bastard‚Äôs parents for bringing him to this world. Probably also questioning why someone with such poor fashion taste would even dare question his or her Design choices.</description>

      <description>We‚Äôve shared a first story about how we started a study between engineers and designers. The outcome was a lot of fun and a CI pipeline from Figma to Android environment called Phantom Box. This story is about the second act of our study.
This time we‚Äôve decided to pinpoint a problem within our company and try fixing it. It needed to be a small scale project just for us to be incubating the whole development process altogether.</description>

      <description>About a year ago we started a small study group with engineers and designers to understand each other better. It was an insightful and fun experience. Fun enough to run 2 different projects summarized over 2 different stories. Here is the first one, sharing both designer and engineer points of views.
At buzzvil we can freely start a study group, lunch being supported for the occasion. It was enough reason for us 5 to start questioning our workflow, 3 product designers and 2 engineers (client &amp;amp; devOps) on a weekly basis.</description>

      <description>This website uses the light-weight Hugo Framework coupled with the Theme Ananke as my starter.
I keep the repository public on my Github if you want to have a look at it. üòè
Ananke is based on the truly impressive Tachyons CSS Library.</description>

      <description>Design system vs startup. Takeaways.
We built a Design system. It took us time, resources and a lot of energy, involving pretty much everyone in our design team. And it‚Äôs just the beginning of a long story. If you are working at a startup and are considering building a design system, you might find clues reading about our experience.
First off, we can‚Äôt ignore how time consuming building a system can be.</description>

      <title>Design peer reviews to support our team growth</title>

      <description>I always hope to see my teammates collaborate more. Now that we are at a stage of faster growth, more fellow designers are going to join us and it felt like a good timing to push forward this all peer-review strategy.
It‚Äôs never too late. We‚Äôve been a team of 4 designers for the last 2 years, including 2 product / 2 visual designers. Collaboration &amp;amp; Review have been naturally there as soon as the team got 2 product designers, but it‚Äôs never been a thing across the entire team, probably due to the fact that some of our designers are working remotely, bringing communication issues.</description>

      <description>Hi, I‚Äôm Max and I lead a team of designers at Buzzvil. When we‚Äôve decided last year to drastically change our design toolbox, I was pleased to find plenty of insights from other teams around the world. This post talks about our decisions and related needs!
To give a quick background, we are a team of 5 designers located in Seoul and Taipei. The team counts 3 Product designers including myself and 2 visual - Brand designers.</description>
