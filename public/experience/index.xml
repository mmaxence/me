      <description>Seoul - 2021 to now I am currently Product Design Lead at buzzvil as well as a Product Owner for our supply business. I handle a cross-disciplinary team of 8 people and I am in charge of the performances of our supply products (Publishers). These new responsibilities came after being given a couple of PM roles over different mission teams. A great way for me to strengthen my business understanding and grow my management skills.</description>

      <description>Seoul - 2018 to 2020 Leading mission teams Since 2018 I&amp;rsquo;ve been leading amazing mission teams. The first mission was about giving the company a strong focus on improving our overall customer experience. This was a cross-disciplinary team and it happened right after our company moved to a matrix organization, adjusting our structure to accommodate the many newcomers and be more scalable. After that mission ended we merged with another mission to regroup and simplify our inventory and I took the lead to ease the transition.</description>

      <description>Seoul - 2014 to Current 2015 New start, new challenges, new life In Late 2014 I joined buzzvil as the lead designer, a dynamic startup based in Seoul. In June I was releasing my first Android and iOS Honeyscreen App with buzzvil. This is the beginning of a long story during which I&amp;rsquo;ve already learned so much!
2016 Work smarter, be lazier I don&amp;rsquo;t consider myself lazy per se, but I do enjoy a lot finding solutions to shorten boring, repetitive work.</description>

      <description>Paris - 2011 to 2014 CMS group (previously 3S Informatique) was my first proper work experience. I spent nearly 4 years working on research-oriented projects. I could adjust the methods I learned at school, learn how to interact inside a development team, and publish my very first research paper in Tokyo.
2011 The real test After taking 2 months break in Korea after my graduation, I started working for a Research Lab incubated by CMS Group, an IT consulting company based in Paris.</description>
