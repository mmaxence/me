      <description>Since 2018 I&amp;rsquo;ve been leading amazing mission teams. The first mission was about giving the company a strong focus on improving our overall customer experience. This was a cross-disciplinary team and it happened right after our company moved to a matrix organization, adjusting our structure to accommodate the many newcomers and be more scalable. After that mission ended we merged with another mission to regroup and simplify our inventory and I took the lead to ease the transition.</description>
