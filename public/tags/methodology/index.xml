      <description>I always hope to see my teammates collaborate more. Now that we are at a stage of faster growth, more fellow designers are going to join us and it felt like a good timing to push forward this all peer-review strategy.
It’s never too late. We’ve been a team of 4 designers for the last 2 years, including 2 product / 2 visual designers. Collaboration &amp;amp; Review have been naturally there as soon as the team got 2 product designers, but it’s never been a thing across the entire team, probably due to the fact that some of our designers are working remotely, bringing communication issues.</description>
