      <description>CMS group (previously 3S Informatique) offered me my first long projects. I spent more than 3 years working on research-oriented projects. I could adjust the methods I learned at school, learn how to interact inside a development team, and publish my very first research paper in Tokyo.
The real test After taking 2 months break in Korea following my graduation, I started working for a Research Lab incubated by CMS Group, an IT consulting company based in Paris.</description>
