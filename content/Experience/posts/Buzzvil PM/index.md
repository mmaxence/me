Since 2018 I've been leading amazing mission teams. The first mission was about giving the company a strong focus on improving our overall customer experience. This was a cross-disciplinary team and it happened right after our company moved to a matrix organization, adjusting our structure to accommodate the many newcomers and be more scalable.
After that mission ended we merged with another mission to regroup and simplify our inventory and I took the lead to ease the transition.
In 2019 I've joined a new project with a few members. This project called Nucleus nurtured and started to show promising results. I took the mission's lead at this time and accompanied the project until completion.
Finally, I could initiate another new mission with a short-term goal. That happened right before our next company reorgnization that would lead me to become Product Owner.
