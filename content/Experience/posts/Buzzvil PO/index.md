##### Seoul - 2021 to now
I recently got promoted to Product Owner for our supply business. I handle a cross-disciplinary team of 8 people and I am in charge of the performances of our supply products (Publishers). These new responsibilities came after a company-wide restructuring, aiming at being more performance-oriented as well as customer-obsessed. A great way for me to strengthen my business understanding and grow my management skills. I intentionally moved further away from product Design to better understand how product business works. In my quest to becoming a better product owner, I found Design methods to be extremely powerful tools.
