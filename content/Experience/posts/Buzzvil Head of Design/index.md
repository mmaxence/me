##### Seoul - 2014 to Current
## 2015
### New start, new challenges, new life

In Late 2014 I joined buzzvil as the lead designer, a dynamic startup based in Seoul. In June I was releasing my first [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.buzzvil.adhours&hl=en) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/kr/app/%ED%97%88%EB%8B%88%EC%8A%A4%ED%81%AC%EB%A6%B0/id591658676) Honeyscreen App with buzzvil. This is the beginning of a long story during which I've already learned so much!

### Work smarter, be lazier
I don't consider myself lazy per se, but I do enjoy a lot finding solutions to shorten boring, repetitive work. This marks a growing interest in <mark>Pattern recognition</mark> and the discovery of <mark>DesignOps</mark>.    
During the second semester, the team was releasing buzzscreen SDK opening our lockscreen technology to partners. Buzzscreen became buzzvil cash cow and still is an important source of revenue.

### Feeling limited
That year is important in my career. This is the time I've decided to invest more in becoming a better leader so that I could achieve more than I could do by myself. I've spent more of my resources learning to be a <mark>greater leader than being a better designer</mark>.    
It materialized in research and theory ([read:](/library/) [High Output Management from Andrew Grove](https://www.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove-ebook/dp/B015VACHOK)) and by consolidating a <mark>hiring strategy</mark> for the next few years.

### The year I became a better manager.
<mark>As I said, being an expert at what you are doing doesn't make you a great manager</mark>. During this year and with a team growing, It was time to put theory into practice. I've learned through hard experiences and great guidance from my managers. Learning the value of delegation and communicating effectively, Becoming a better manager.

### Opening Design to anyone
Late this year, We've internally published the first version of our Design system. <mark>From now on anyone in the company can access and <i>play Lego</i> with our components and layouts</mark>. Since then we've seen different teams using these assets to mockup things such as what a potential partner integration would look like over our White Label SDK. Designers are asked to help out if requested but our time can now focus on upcoming releases!

The team recently published an online version of our [Design System](https://design.buzzvil.com). ðŸŽŠ   
Building a Design system is more a story about team organization, workflow, and Principles than it is about Components.
