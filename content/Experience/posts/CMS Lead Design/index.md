##### Paris - 2011 to 2014

CMS group (previously 3S Informatique) was my first proper work experience. I spent more than 3 years working on research-oriented projects. I could adjust the methods I learned at school, learn how to interact inside a development team, and publish my very first research paper in Tokyo.

## 2011
### The real test
After taking 2 months break in Korea following my graduation, I started working for a Research Lab incubated by CMS Group, an IT consulting company based in Paris. Most of my work this year happened to be in the Arts & Metiers campus, closely working with a team of researchers to shape the concept of what will keep me busy for the next 3 years. My workplace changed to CMS Group (formerly 3S) Product team after the research, identification, and ideation phases of the design thinking process were done. This year the project got founded by the E.U. as a research project.

## 2012
### Interest in coding to better design
I've learned a lot during this year, closely working with a team of engineers from the early stages of our product to the alpha version. I've learned from mistakes, iterating fast. I built my first UI system based on Bootstrap. With this live UI library, I could control the entire appearance of our LMS throughout these CSS/JS-based style guides and layouts. This decision was based on the many headaches I encountered to hand off my Design to developers.

## 2013
### When Design meets Research
Because outcomes were worth sharing, I've co-published a paper called ""The CO-SI Card method: how to refine and validate concepts through a scenario generator framework" " at [IASDR](https://iasdr.net/) Tokyo about co-design with Cédric Mivielle.
That same year our project moved to the alpha version, I've been allowed to assist and collaborate with the Randstad training team to test the platform in real conditions.

## 2014
### Time to wrap up, communicate on achievements & move on!
I've introduced my experience as an Interaction design Alumni during this year's [open days](https://www.lecolededesign.com/actualites/portes-ouvertes-2014-conferences-et-temoignages-d-anciens-1771) at my former school l'école de design de Nantes Atlantique.

I've participated in a European Campus which was about UX Design and learning services organized by the University of Poitiers. I lectured about being a [UX designer working on a professional training platform](https://uptv.univ-poitiers.fr/program/campus-europeen-d-ete-201s from the KAIST campus, and kids from local schools to be imagining the Daejeon city in 2050.
