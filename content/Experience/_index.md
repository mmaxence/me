Now, let's get back in time. Here is how things worked out for me at buzzvil over these past 6 years.



### Leading a mission team
Later last year I've started leading an amazing mission team called UXP (User eXPerience) with for goal to enhance our usability and test new features. The team consisted of 2 designers, 3 client engineers, 1 server engineer, and a PM. For many of us, it was the first time closely working with different fields and we learned a lot from this experience. We've made mistakes that make us all today much stronger than we were. The mission eventually ended up last July and merged with another team to help us move our inventory through our new vision. I've co-led this inventory Lab team that eventually ended recently, moving my focus to upcoming products.

## 2020
### A better business understanding
After being given a chance to lead a product team back in 2019, my responsibilities over product management increased. Throughout 2 different teams, I could improve my capacity to manage projects and cross-functional teams. The first mission team was co-led with my CEO, Young. I learned tons of things in a very short time. Once Young judged I could lead on my own, he put me in charge of a new team focused on the product I helped initiate in this previous mission. A truly great experience during which I could overcome some of the toughest learning curves I faced in my career. This year noted a slight move from Design even though I've never neglected my leadership responsibilities. In early 2021 eventually saw my position as Head of Design narrowed to Product Design in order to give myself a greater focus and take on new challenges as Product Owner.
