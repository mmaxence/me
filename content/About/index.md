This website uses the light-weight [Hugo Framework](https://gohugo.io/) coupled with the Theme [Ananke](https://github.com/budparr/gohugo-theme-ananke) as my starter.

I keep the repository public on my [Github](https://github.com/mmaxence/mmaxence.github.io) if you want to have a look at it. 😏

Ananke is based on the truly impressive [Tachyons](https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons/) CSS Library.
